# BRIIM Website Content

BRIIM is a community effort and thus your contribution is highly welcomed! If you add new items to the list, make sure they have a high quality and supportive ripple effect on the learning experience and remaining learning material. For instance, libraries should have a clear focus on an area of expertise. For instance, a library implementing Support Vector Machines (SVM) has a qualitative focus on one subject. Keep that in mind, but please propose your articles, learning material, libraries and projects in a Pull Request.
